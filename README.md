## About 

Me playing around with the Hugo framework (an open-source static site generator) to host a website.

The site runs live at https://hugo-framework.netlify.app/.

It contains configurations and instructions on how to download and install a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/.

## To Run

* Run `hugo serve` in the root directory of the codebase.
* Once completed, navigate to `localhost:1313` in a browser.

## To Build

* Run `hugo` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the **public** directory.
