# hugo-framework

Me playing around with the Hugo framework (an open-source static site generator) to host a quick, simple website. 

The site runs live at https://hugo-framework.netlify.app/.

It contains configurations and instructions on how to download and install a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/.
