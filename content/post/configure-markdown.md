## Configuring Markdown files

Each markdown file should have an intro at the beginning, similar to the one in this file. Make sure that at the start of your markdown file you confirm the following details:
- The name of the file (title)
- The date 
- If it is a draft. If this is set to `true`, the file will not be displayed in the list of posts.
- The category will display on the bottom-right of the preview.
- The icon is shown to the right of the category name.
